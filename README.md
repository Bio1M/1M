I may replace this with a container repo in Dushoff.

This is the repo repo for the Bio1M organization. It is meant to be nested inside master, but I haven't done that yet (it complicates the submodule structure, and I'm still debugging that).

Sub-repos:

* Lectures (where I prepare lectures)

* These should probably be cleaned out -- DRY
	* Bio1M.github.io web site (also inside lectures, why is that good?)
	* images/ (also inside lectures!)

* Archive (old stuff that is not secret)

* 1m_2017 test material from 2017
