* make makestuff.msync
	(Needed to dash out some includes)
* make makestuff.msync
* make ruc
(A huge mess of headless submodules)
* git status
	(cleanish)
* make rmaster
* git status
	(a moderate mess, probably with layers)
* make hup
	(Need some ignore stuff first)
	(but there's no rule for broadcasting it yet!)
* make srstuff
* make hybridignore
	(several problems, including staged .gitignore)
* make hup
	(seems a lot of good things happened; problems with the web directories (maybe they weren't clean to start with, and they're competing, and problems here (including this file))
	* maybe a problem with dependencies (used *.*) inappropriately
* make bump
* make srstuff
* make hup
	* make: Nothing to be done for 'hup'. RIDICULOUS!!
